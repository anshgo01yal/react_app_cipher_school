This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the repo for my 'Creating a Shopping List App using ReactÂ Hooks' tutorial on Medium.

## How to get project working


### `cd shopping-list-tutorial`

Then install dependencies:

### `npm install`

Next, start the project:

### `npm start`

And voila!
